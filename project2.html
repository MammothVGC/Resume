      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This very site serves as one of my projects. It’s a personal resume website 
        designed and developed entirely by me, showcasing my HTML and web development skills. 
        The project is an ongoing work-in-progress and is regularly upgraded with new features 
        and pages.
